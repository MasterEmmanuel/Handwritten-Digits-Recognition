# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition

This project covers the (simple) application and use of neural networks. And as can be found on this project folder, the project spans into two units; one for a deep neural network making use of 3 hidden layers(of varying nodes) and the other, a somewhat simple neural, and both are equipped with lines of codes to kickstart the training and testing of netwokIn the deep neural network pyth data against the dataset that we'll be obtaining from MNIST.
